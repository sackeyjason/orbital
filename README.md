## Dev log

### 2024 Feb 26 - reviving the project after a long pause

There's been a regression. The settled shapes turn grey, but previously I had an enhancement whereby the shapes' colours got muted, desaturated, not completely greyed out, when placed. I removed this because it had an external dependency, a colour library, and I removed that, since this isn't an npm project. There's no package manager. Just my code. I'll keep it this way for now.

Officially open source - Zero-Clause BSD.
